# LG webOS TV Tools

Only one tool here at the moment: a bash script to run on a rooted TV to update the recently expired LetsEncrypt CA cert
ificates (useful for Plex or Emby setups that use LetsEncrypt certificates, since LG have not updated the CA certs on ma
ny TVs). You must have root on your TV. Once you have shell access, download this script with wget and run it.
